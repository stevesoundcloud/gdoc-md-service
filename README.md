## Project conventions

### Git

- `branches-are-named-like-this`
- All merges to master should be based on feature branches, which, unless there are really exceptional
circumstances, should be squashed / single-commit, with some (30-120s) attention paid
to a good final commit message, that is appropriately descriptive for an audience of future maintainers
that are not the same person as the author.
